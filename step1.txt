Step One: Planning

Question: 1 
what HTML would be useful for the game board itself?
Answer: 1
My first though is to use a table... We could use 6 x rows and 7 x td to build the board
or
Go with HTML canvas, witch will be much harder because i don't know canvas but will end up being the most awesome project.

Question: 2
how could you represent a played-piece in the HTML board?
Answer: 2 
SVG would be ok, or create an canvas drawing to represent it

Question: 3
in the JavaScript, what would be a good structure for the in-memory game board?
Answer: 3
database driven or local storage for data persistance, in game data structure could be object because its so small performance wont be an issue, but for practice we will use a hashtable with map and sets

Question: 4
what might the flow of the game be?
Answer: 4
splash screen with a setting disply... then select 2 player mode or vs computer AI mode, pick color and who goes first. Animation to start game and show board...

Question: 5
Then, write down some functions names/descriptions that would be useful for this game.
 Answer: 5
const init = ()=>{
    // window.onload function
    // this would trigger the animation to start game - show setting splash screen
    //maybe make calls to db for past game if making accounts...
}
const handleSetting = ()=>{
    //this would take user options selected and build game with thoes params
}

const makeGameBoard = ()=>{
    //i dont know how to use canvas yet, but this function i would dynamicly build the canvas board and be awaiting user inputs
}

const handleClick = ()=>{
    //this would handle user clicks to select where to drop next game peace
}

const isWin = ()=>{
    //would check to see if someone won
}

const winner = ()=>{
    //end of game animation on win and maybe lose as well
}

const score = () => {
    maybe some sort of game score or timer counter...
}

const reset = ()=>{
    //reset on win or whenever
}
